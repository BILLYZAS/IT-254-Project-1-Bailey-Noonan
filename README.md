# IT-254-Project-1-Bailey-Noonan
This Arduino Mega 2560 program leverages AI-powered speech recognition to detect voice commands. When it recognizes the keyword 'turn on,' it activates the LED on pin 13. Conversely, upon detecting 'turn off,' it deactivates the LED. This intelligent system enables hands-free control through natural voice input.
